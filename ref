First we create a basic nestjs project:
$ npm i -g @nestjs/cli
$ nest new project-name

cd to the new project then install passport:
npm i @nestjs/passport passport passport-oauth2
npm i -D @types/passport-oauth2
[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

This projects tuto has deprecated libraries etc. It may need some more fixes like I did on mac.
I had to:
```bash
npm install core-js
npm install -D babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env webpac
npm audit fix
```bash

Some problems might come from my install on mac too - or the network itself (don't like the ssl or app) a proxy might fix it.
